<br />
<small>BY EMMA HOWARD WIGHT.</small></div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span></h2>


<p>In the Land of Israel, not a great
distance from the city of Samaria,
dwelt Ezra with his wife, Sarah, and
their two children, Isaac and Leah.
The sun was sinking behind the hills
as Ezra and Sarah sat before the door
of their humble dwelling resting after
the labors of the day. On a couch in
the doorway reclined a youth with a
pale, sickly face and emaciated limbs.
Isaac, the eldest-born of Ezra and
Sarah, had been a cripple from birth.
His eyes, dull and languid from constant
pain, tired and sad, were fixed
eagerly upon the wide white road
stretching away in the distance until
it was lost among the hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>At length, with an impatient sigh,
he turned his pale, wan face towards
his mother and said:</p>

<p>"See, mother, the sun has nearly
set; why tarryeth Leah so long? 'Twas
but sunrise when she did set out for
Samaria, surely she should have returned
ere this."</p>

<p>"Thou dost forget, my son, that
thy sister had much to do in Samaria,"
replied Sarah, soothingly. "First to
dispose of the fruits and then to purchase
necessities for our household;
also the ass of our neighbor being old
and stiff, can travel but slowly."</p>

<p>"All that thou urgeth be true,
mother," exclaimed the lad, petulantly.
"But my sister has ever
the same tasks, still she always returned
from Samaria before the setting
of the sun. I fear that some ill hath
befallen her," and his lip quivered
with pain while his large, soft eyes
dilated with fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"How now, lad! why dost thou
frighten thy mother with thy sickly
fancies?" cried Ezra, impatiently, as
Sarah's cheek grew pale. "What ill
could have befallen thy sister?"</p>

<p>"She may have fallen into the hands
of the Syrians, whom thou knoweth
do make raids into our country and
carry off captives," answered the lad,
tremulously. "Oh, if I were only as
other lads these burdens should not
fall upon the weak shoulders of a
maiden. 'Twould be I who would
journey into Samaria with the fruits,"
and tears of bitter pain and humiliation
filled his eyes.</p>

<p>Sarah leaned forward and gently
smoothed back the dark, curling hair
from his white brow.</p>

<p>"Speak not thus, my son," she
murmured, with infinite tenderness.
"Thy mother loveth thee but the
more tenderly because of thy affliction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and well dost thou know how
thy sister's heart yearneth over thee."</p>

<p>A faint smile touched the lad's pale
lips.</p>

<p>"Ah, mother," he said, "it is wicked
of me to repine at my affliction when
thou and my sister, Leah, do love me
so well. But, oh, mother, if I were
but strong and whole," and, covering
his face with his hands, he sobbed
aloud.</p>

<p>"Look up, lad, and dry thy tears,
for yonder cometh our Leah," cried
Ezra.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of joy, Isaac
obeyed, and, lifting himself eagerly
upon his elbow, watched with joyous
eyes, the slow approach of an ass
upon which was seated a maiden.</p>

<p>Ezra went forward and lifted her to
the ground.</p>

<p>"Leah! sister! thou art come at
last!" cried Isaac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>She ran to the couch and bent over
him; his weak arms clasped her neck,
his eyes looked lovingly into her face.</p>

<p>The brother and sister had the same
fine-cut features and beautiful, soft,
dark eyes, but the lad's face was white
and wan, while the rich bloom of
health colored the cheeks and lips of
the maiden. Her dark hair, curly
and silken, fell to her waist; she was
slenderly built, but erect, graceful and
quick of movement.</p>

<p>"Why didst thou tarry so long, my
child?" asked Sarah. "Thy brother
has sorely fretted, fearing that some
ill had befallen thee."</p>

<p>"I am sorry that thou didst fret,
brother," said the maiden, bending to
kiss his pale brow.</p>

<p>"Hadst thou trouble in disposing of
the fruits, maiden?" asked Ezra.</p>

<p>"No, dear father," replied Leah,
turning towards him with a smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
"I was but a little while selling the
fruits and making the purchases for
my mother."</p>

<p>"Then it was the slowness of our
neighbor's ass which did delay thee,"
said Ezra.</p>

<p>"I will tell thee, father, why I did
tarry so long in Samaria," said the
maiden. "They were talking in
Samaria of the wonders wrought by
the prophet, Elisha, and I lingered
to listen. 'Twas of his last miracle
that they did speak. Father, mother,
brother, knoweth thou that the prophet,
Elisha, hath power to raise the
dead to life?"</p>

<p>She paused and turned her eyes
upon the helpless form of the cripple
lad while the color deepened upon her
cheek and her breath came quickly.
Isaac spoke not, but, as his eyes met
his sister's, they lighted with passionate
eagerness and a long, panting sigh
left his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"What sayeth thou, maiden, that
the prophet, Elisha, hath power to
raise the dead to life?" cried Ezra,
wonderingly and incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, father," answered Leah.
"Listen, and I will tell to thee what I
heard in Samaria. There is a woman
in Shunem who didst bear to her husband
in his old age a son. This
woman, who is charitable and good,
is well known to Elisha. Indeed she
had prepared a chamber for him in
her home where he did rest and take
refreshment when he travelled on foot
from place to place. One morning,
when the woman's child was but five
years of age, he went into the field
where his father was gathering in the
harvest, and, there, he suddenly sickened
from the heat of the sun. They
carried him to his mother, she held
him in her arms and, after some
hours, he died. She took him up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the little chamber where the prophet
had rested and laid him upon the bed.
Then, commanding the servant to
saddle an ass, she set out to seek
Elisha who was at Mount Carmel.</p>

<p>"Elisha, standing upon the summit,
near the altar of Jehovah, saw
her a-far off, for he sent his servant
to inquire if all were well with her.
But the woman would herself speak
with the prophet, and, falling at his
feet, did tell him that her son was
dead. Elisha then returned with the
woman to Shunem and shut himself
into the room with the dead child.
After a little while he called his servant
and told him to summon the
mother, and, when she did come into
the room, Elisha said to her, 'Take
up thy child,' and the child was risen
from the dead."</p>

<p>The little maid ceased speaking,
and throwing herself on her knees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
beside the couch, put her arms gently
about Isaac's frail form.</p>

<p>"Sister," murmured the lad, touching
tenderly with his thin fingers the
curling hair which fell upon her
shoulders, "I know the thoughts in
thy tender heart. Thou art thinking
that if this great prophet hath power
to raise the dead to life, then also
hath he the power to make strong and
straight these poor limbs of mine.
Tell me, dear sister, are not these thy
thoughts?"</p>

<p>"Yes! ah, indeed, yes!" cried the
maiden, in a voice of passionate tenderness
and yearning. "But I did
not wish thee to know what was in
my heart until I had spoken with our
parents."</p>

<p>She arose and turned towards Ezra
and Sarah. Both regarded her in
silence; Ezra, pale and grave, Sarah,
with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father, wilt thou give me leave to
seek the prophet, Elisha, who dwelleth
in Samaria that I may beg of
him to heal my brother?" asked the
maiden.</p>

<p>"Dost thou believe, maiden, that
the wonderful things they relate of
this Elisha be true?" asked Ezra.</p>

<p>Into the maiden's soft eyes there
crept a troubled look.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear father speak not thus,"
she cried, imploringly. "Surely thou
knoweth that unless we have faith,
nothing will be granted unto us. Why
shouldst thou or I doubt the wonders
imputed to Elisha, for is he not a holy
man of God?"</p>

<p>"Thou art only a maiden, but thou
speaketh words of wisdom which do
rebuke thy father," said Ezra. "Tell
me, my son," turning to Isaac, "dost
thou also believe that this man, Elisha,
hath power to heal thee, who art from
thy birth a cripple?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The lad looked, smiling, up into
his father's face.</p>

<p>"Yes, father, I do indeed believe
that Elisha hath power to heal me,"
he replied. "Even though he had
not raised the dead to life still would
my faith in him be great, for, as Leah
sayeth, he be a holy man of God."</p>

<p>Ezra moved forward and laid his
hand on the maiden's dark head.</p>

<p>"Thy brother also hath great faith,"
he said. "Thou shalt seek Elisha in
Samaria and make known to him thy
desire."</p>

<p>Leah caught her father's hand and
raised it to her lips.</p>

<p>"I thank thee, my father," she
murmured.</p>

<p>"Dost thou think that Elisha will
harken to thy request?" asked Ezra.</p>

<p>"I am sure that he will, for Elisha
never turneth a deaf ear to the sorrowful
and the afflicted," answered Leah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
"Father, when may I journey to
Samaria and seek the prophet?"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, have patience, maiden,"
said Ezra. "We will talk of
that later, now 'tis time to prepare
the evening meal. Assist thy mother,
while I go forth and feed our neighbor's
ass."</p>

<p>He turned away.</p>

<p>The sun had set, but a faint flush
of crimson still lingered in the west.
The ass stood patiently, with drooping
head.</p>

<p>A light flashed out from the low
doorway. Ezra, as he fed and watered
the tired beast, could see his wife and
daughter moving about within; also
the form of the cripple lad stretched
upon the couch. Would that wan
cheek ever glow with health? mused
Ezra. That weak body be upright
and sturdy, those helpless limbs strong
and straight?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"From his birth hath he been a
cripple, sickly and helpless," murmured
Ezra. "But surely this man
who hath power even to raise the
dead to life can heal a cripple lad."</p>

<p>"Father! father!"</p>

<p>Leah stood in the doorway, her
cheeks the color of roses, the night
breeze lifting her heavy curls, her soft
eyes gazing forth into the gathering
shadows.</p>

<p>"Come, dear father, the evening
meal is ready," she said.</p>

<p>The day's tasks were done. Isaac,
exhausted with the emotions and excitement
of the day, slept heavily
upon his couch. Ezra and Sarah sat
in the doorway and the little maid
lay upon the ground at their feet,
with her curly head resting against
her mother's knee.</p>

<p>"Art thou fatigued with thy journey,
maiden?" asked Sarah, touching caressingly
Leah's rose-flushed cheek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fatigued!" repeated the maiden,
with a smile. "No, dear mother, thy
Leah is young and strong; 'tis only
the poor old ass that is weary."</p>

<p>Ezra sat buried in thought. Now
and again the little maid glanced
wistfully up into his face. She longed
passionately to learn when it was his
will for her to seek the prophet in
Samaria, but it never occurred to her
to question her father or manifest any
signs of impatience.</p>

<p>A silence fell upon the three. Sarah
thought that the little maid had fallen
asleep, so still she lay, but, as Ezra
suddenly roused himself and spoke,
Leah, sat upright, her eyes eagerly
seeking his face across which the light
from within fell.</p>

<p>"Maiden," said Ezra, "I have been
considering the matter of thy seeking
the prophet, Elisha, in Samaria.
When ten days have passed the fruits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
will again have ripened; then will I
borrow the ass of our neighbor and
thou shalt journey to Samaria. When
thou hast sold thy fruits thou canst
seek the prophet, Elisha."</p>

<p>Leah's eyes filled with tears, her
lips quivered, she was bitterly disappointed.
To wait ten days when she
hoped and longed to start with the
coming dawn for Samaria.</p>

<p>"Thou didst hear me, maiden?"
said Ezra, as she did not speak.</p>

<p>"Yes, my father," she replied, as
she wiped away her tears. "'Tis thy
will that I again journey to Samaria
when ten days shall have passed."</p>

<p>"Such is my will," said Ezra.</p>

<p>The little maid laid her head again
upon her mother's lap and looked,
with longing, wistful eyes, into the
darkness towards Samaria.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h2>


<p>"Sister, how many days have passed
since thou didst return from Samaria?"
asked Isaac, as Leah, her morning's
work completed, seated herself beside
his couch.</p>

<p>"Five, brother," replied the little
maid. "So but five more remain and
then I shall again journey to Samaria."</p>

<p>The lad sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"Every day that dawns is long and
dreary to me," he said; "but these
last five days have seemed indeed the
longest and dreariest of all my life.
Leah, sometimes during the long,
pain-racked hours of the night, my
heart hath risen in bitterness against
my father that he so long delayeth
thy journey to Samaria."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, dear brother, speak not
thus," said the little maid, gently.
"Our father knoweth best."</p>

<p>"But, Leah," cried the lad, his eyes
lighting eagerly, a faint flush staining
the pallor of his cheek, "if our father
had permitted thee to journey at once
to Samaria, perhaps, when the fruits
were ripe it would have been I who
didst carry them to Samaria."</p>

<p>"Be patient a little longer, dear
brother," said Leah. "And promise
me that thou wilt not again cherish
bitter thoughts against our father,"
she added, earnestly.</p>

<p>"I promise thee, sister," answered
the lad. "Poor father, 'tis a heavy
burden upon him that his eldest-born
and only son should be a cripple;
that while he toileth I lie here helpless,
unable to give him a helping
hand, to lighten his labor. But, oh,
Leah, sister, how happy I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
when the prophet, Elisha, hath made
me whole. How proudly shall I labor
by my father's side; and thou shalt
journey no more to Samaria; thou
shalt stay at our mother's side while
I carry the fruits to the city and
purchase necessities for our household.
Sister! Sister! what did the
woman of Shunem when Elisha raised
her child from the dead?"</p>

<p>"She fell in gratitude at the feet of
Elisha," answered the little maid.</p>

<p>"I shall also fall in gratitude at the
feet of Elisha when he hath made me
whole," said Isaac.</p>

<p>"Thou must not forget to offer up
prayers of gratitude to the great Jehovah
from whom cometh the power
of Elisha," said Leah, gently.</p>

<p>Ezra was at work in the fields when
he saw his wife, Sarah, approaching.</p>

<p>"What seeketh thou, Sarah?" he
asked, as she drew near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would speak with thee, Ezra,"
replied Sarah.</p>

<p>"Of what wouldst thou speak,
Sarah, that thou seeketh me in the
fields at my labor?" asked Ezra.
"Canst thou not wait until the day's
toil be ended?"</p>

<p>"Nay, or I would not seek thee
at thy labor," answered Sarah. "I
would not speak with thee of this before
our children lest they think
that thy wife hold but lightly her
husband's judgment. Ezra, the hearts
of our children are sad that thou
delayeth the maiden's journey to
Samaria."</p>

<p>"Our children be young and
knoweth not patience," said Ezra.</p>

<p>"Nay, Ezra, our son and eldest-born
hath never known youth,"
sadly answered Sarah. "Youth is
sturdy of body, light of limb, joyous
of heart. Isaac knoweth naught of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
these things. Impatient, sayeth thou,
Ezra? Ay, and thou also would be
impatient, even with the years of
wisdom upon thy shoulders, if thou
wert crippled from birth, and when
the light of hope shone, for the first
time, across thy dark pathway, thou
wert bidden to wait."</p>

<p>"'Tis but a few days until the
fruits shall have ripened," muttered
Ezra.</p>

<p>"Ay, thou art right," said Sarah,
"'tis but a few days, but a little while
ago I did hear our son say that the
five days of waiting had been the
longest and dreariest of a life in
which every day is long and dreary."</p>

<p>"Thou art but a woman, Sarah,
and the softness of thy heart doth
steal away thy wisdom," said Ezra.</p>

<p>"'Tis not so much the woman's
heart as the mother's that doth plead
with thee, Ezra," replied Sarah, the
tears filling her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go back to thy children and thy
work, woman," commanded Ezra.
"And when the day's toil be ended
we will speak of this again."</p>

<p>Sarah turned obediently away, but
her heart was light, for her husband
had not said her nay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Come hither, maiden," said Ezra.</p>

<p>The evening meal was over and
the night shadows were falling. Leah
arose from beside her father's couch
and approached Ezra.</p>

<p>"Little maid," said Ezra, "maketh
thyself ready, for to-morrow, at the
dawning of the day, our neighbor
will bring his ass and thou shalt set
forth for Samaria."</p>

<p>The maiden's lips parted eagerly
with surprise and joy. The lad, lifted
himself upon his elbow, and gazed
upon his father with radiant eyes.</p>

<p>"But, father, the fruits are not yet
ripe," faltered Leah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true," replied Ezra. "But
we shall not wait until the fruits have
ripened. Art thou not eager, maiden,
to seek the prophet, Elisha, in Samaria
that thou mayest beg of him to heal
thy brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dear father," cried the
little maid, with shining eyes and
flushing cheeks.</p>

<p>"Then make ready to start upon
thy journey at the dawn of day," said
Ezra.</p>

<p>"I shall be ready, dear father,"
replied Leah.</p>

<p>She turned and went back to her
brother's couch. She knelt down beside
him and slipped her hand in his.
He lifted the little hand to his lips
and kissed it reverently and tenderly.</p>

<p>When in the gray dawn of the early
morning Leah entered Isaac's chamber
she found him sleeping. She
pressed a kiss upon his brow and
stole softly out again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou didst find thy brother sleeping,"
said Sarah. "He passed a night
of pain and restlessness and now
sleepeth from exhaustion. But it will
fret him not to have bidden thee
farewell."</p>

<p>"'Tis well that he is resting after
his night of pain," said Leah. "Tell
him, dear mother, that I kissed him
as he slept."</p>

<p>"Come, maiden," called Ezra from
without.</p>

<p>"Fare-thee-well, dear mother,"
murmured the little maid.</p>

<p>Sarah kissed tenderly the sweet,
upturned face.</p>

<p>"Fare-thee-well, my child," she
said, tremulously. "God be with
thee."</p>

<p>Then the little maid passed through
the doorway and out into the grayness
of the breaking day. Ezra lifted
her upon the ass's back and she turned
her face towards Samaria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>When Isaac awoke he called his
mother to him and said:</p>

<p>"Mother, has my sister started for
Samaria?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son," replied Sarah.</p>

<p>His lips quivered.</p>

<p>"Why didst thou not awaken me,
mother, that I might bid my sister
farewell?" he said.</p>

<p>"Thou wert resting, my son, after
thy night of pain," answered Sarah.
"Thy sister would not have thee
awakened, but bid me say to thee
that she kissed thee as thou slept.
See," pointing to a golden gleam of
sunlight which forced itself through
the window and lay athwart the bed,
"'tis the first ray of the rising sun;
ere it sets thy sister will be again
with thee."</p>

<p>And the lad lay gazing, with a smile
upon his lips, at the shaft of golden
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Ezra labored all day in the fields.
The sun was sinking low in the heavens
when he saw approaching the
neighbor whose ass he had borrowed.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, neighbor," said
Ezra. "Thou art come too soon for
thy ass; the maiden hath not yet
returned."</p>

<p>"I come not for the ass, neighbor,"
replied the man, whose name was
Simeon. "I bring thee ill tidings."</p>

<p>"What meaneth thou, neighbor?"
asked Ezra.</p>

<p>"Ill hath befallen thy little maid,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"Ill hath befallen my little maid,"
repeated Ezra, bewilderedly. "Speak,
man, what ill?"</p>

<p>"She has been taken captive by
the Syrians," answered Simeon.</p>

<p>"How knoweth thou this?" asked
Ezra.</p>

<p>"I will tell thee," said his neighbor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
"But a little while ago a stranger
did come to my house mounted upon
my own ass. 'Be this beast thine?'
he did ask me. Much astonished I
replied that the ass were mine.
'And the maiden who rode it, was she
thy daughter?' asked the stranger.
I replied that she was not my daughter,
but the little maid of my neighbor,
Ezra. Then the stranger said to me,
'Go to thy neighbor Ezra and tell him
that his little maid hath been taken
captive by the Syrians; that she will
be carried to Damascus and sold into
slavery.'</p>

<p>"It doth appear," continued Simeon,
as Ezra stood pale and speechless,
"that this man was traveling on
foot from Samaria when he saw approaching
from the direction of Damascus,
a company of Syrians. They
were evidently bent upon plunder, and
the man, fearing that they would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
him captive, did hide himself. While
in hiding he saw the Syrians fall in
with a little maid mounted upon an
ass. The maiden they did take captive,
leaving the ass which is old and
slow. When the Syrians had departed
with the little maid, the stranger came
forth and mounted the ass, turning its
face in the direction from whence it
came. And the ass returned home.
It is with sorrow in my heart, neighbor,
that I bring thee ill tidings of thy
little maid."</p>

<p>"Ay, ill tidings indeed!" murmured
Ezra, his head sunk in sorrow upon
his breast. "The hand of the Lord
hath fallen heavily upon me and
mine. How shall I tell the lad, for
whose sake she did journey towards
Samaria, of the ill that hath befallen
his sister? Alas! alas! our little maid
captured by the Syrians! sold into
slavery!" and Ezra rent his garments
and wept bitterly.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter III.</span></h2>


<p>Naaman, commander-in-chief of the
Syrian Army, was passing through the
streets of Damascus in a magnificent
chariot drawn by four snow-white
horses. He was a man of great height
and superb physique; he wore a robe of
royal purple. But upon the proud
face there rested a heavy shadow, and
the dark, flashing eyes, which had
looked death in the face unflinchingly
so many times upon the battle-field,
now drooped under the pitying and
curious glances bent upon him.</p>

<p>A sigh of intense relief heaved his
mighty chest when the chariot stopped
before the gates of a stately palace.
He stepped from the chariot and
passed within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say to thy mistress that I desire
her presence," he said to a servant,
and then passed on to a splendid
chamber.</p>

<p>With his arms clasped across his
breast he paced restlessly up and down
the vast length of the chamber.</p>

<p>"Ah," he murmured, "Naaman,
whom all Syria doth call a mighty
man of valor, knoweth fear for the first
time. My hand doth tremble like a
woman's, my limbs are weak. Never
have her sweet eyes looked into mine
save with tenderness, but now&mdash;alas!
alas! that Naaman should be so
accursed."</p>

<p>The heavy silken draperies of the
doorway were put aside and a woman
entered the chamber. She was very
beautiful with skin of dazzling fairness
and hair of wondrous gold color.
She was clad in rich garments of
white, embroidered with gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Naaman, my husband," she
murmured, tenderly.</p>

<p>At the sound of her sweet voice
Naaman started, turned, moved towards
her and then abruptly paused.</p>

<p>"Thou didst desire my presence,
my lord," she continued, falteringly,
for his face was white and stern, and
she remembered how of late he had
appeared so cold and changed. As he
did not speak, she added, "I fear that
some trouble doth sore oppress thee.
For some time I have noted the pallor
on thy cheek, the shadow on thy
brow. I longed to know thy trouble
that I might comfort thee, but thou
art ever silent. Wilt thou not confide
in me, Naaman? Surely thou knoweth
that thy Claudia desireth not alone to
share thy riches and thy honors, but
thy sorrows also," and, moving to his
side, she laid her beautiful white hand
upon his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>He started back, thrusting her almost
roughly aside.</p>

<p>"Touch me not, woman!" he cried;
"for I am&mdash;unclean."</p>

<p>She stared at him, her eyes dark
with horror, the delicate bloom fading
from cheeks and lips. He shuddered
and covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>"Naaman, what meaneth thou?"
she asked. "My husband, speak."</p>

<p>His hands fell, he turned and faced
her.</p>

<p>"Claudia," he said, "this morning,
as I passed through the streets of Damascus,
glances of pity and loathing
were cast upon me, until, I, Naaman,
did bow my head in shame. I have
riches, fame and honor, but the very
beggars in the streets do pity me for
I am a&mdash;leper."</p>

<p>She shrank back with a faint cry.</p>

<p>"Ay, 'tis true," he continued, bitterly.
"All Damascus doth know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
what I have feared to tell to thee
because I love thee; because I did fear
to read in thy sweet eyes the horror and
the loathing with which all regard
me. The leper is accursed, unclean,
whom many loathe, all pity, but none
may love."</p>

<p>"Nay, thou art wrong," murmured
Claudia, tenderly. "Thy wife doth
love thee, ay, but the more tenderly
because of thy affliction."</p>

<p>Into Naaman's haggard eyes there
flashed a look of joy.</p>

<p>"Then Naaman careth not for the
pitying and loathing of all Syria since
Claudia still loveth him," he cried.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Claudia, wife of Naaman, was wandering
listlessly through the beautiful
grounds which surrounded the palace.
Her lovely face was pale, her eyes
full of sadness. She rarely went beyond
the grounds of the palace, shrinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
from the compassionate glances
bent upon her, and the murmurs
which too often reached her ears:</p>

<p>"See! 'tis Claudia, the wife of Naaman,
the leper."</p>

<p>Suddenly through the gates of the
palace there came a little maid. She
was poorly-clad, but, as she drew near,
her sweet face attracted the attention
of Claudia.</p>

<p>"Who art thou, little one?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I am Leah, a slave," replied
the little maid, while her dark head
drooped in shame.</p>

<p>"A slave!" repeated Claudia.
"Cometh thou not from the land of
Israel?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Leah. "I was captured
by a company of Syrians while
on my way to Samaria, brought to
Damascus and placed in the slave
market where I was bought by Eucadeus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
a wine-merchant. 'Tis he who
hath sent me to the palace of Naaman
where he selleth his wine."</p>

<p>"Captured and sold into slavery&mdash;'tis
a hard fate for one so young," murmured
Claudia, musingly. "Knoweth
thou who I am, maiden?"</p>

<p>"I know not who thou art," replied
the little maid, with a smile. "But I
see that thou art very beautiful, and
my heart doth tell me that thou art
good. Thou art also a great lady, for
thou weareth rich garments and rare
jewels."</p>

<p>Claudia smiled.</p>

<p>"Thy answer doth please me, little
maid; thou hath an apt tongue," she
said. "I am Claudia, wife of Naaman."</p>

<p>The soft, dark eyes of the little
maid were lifted to Claudia's face
with a swift look of compassion. For
a moment Claudia shrank back and
was silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," she thought, "even this
slave-girl knoweth that Naaman is a
leper and doth pity Naaman's wife.
Wouldst thou like to enter my service,
maiden?" she asked. "If so, no
doubt, thou canst be bought of thy
master, Eucadeus."</p>

<p>Leah's eyes lighted with rapture.</p>

<p>"Ay, lady, glad indeed would I be
to enter thy service," she replied.
"I am sure thou couldst buy me of
Eucadeus, for he loveth gold above
all things."</p>

<p>"Then I shall send my chief
steward to Eucadeus," said Claudia.
"Now, hasten, maiden, to do thy
errand, lest thy master chide thee
for tarrying."</p>

<p>Claudia returned to the palace and,
summoning her chief steward, said
to him:</p>

<p>"Seek thou the wine-merchant,
Eucadeus, and say to him that Claudia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wife of Naaman, would purchase
of him Leah, the little Israelite
maid, upon whom he may set his
own price."</p>

<p>The chief steward accordingly went
to do his mistress' bidding.</p>

<p>Eucadeus, a hard, cruel, grasping
fellow, who put upon the little maid
tasks far beyond her strength, was at
first unwilling to part with his slave.
But, upon learning that it was Claudia,
wife of Naaman, who desired to
purchase her, and that he might name
his own price, he quickly changed his
mind and bargained with the chief
steward for a price just double that
which he had paid for the maiden.</p>

<p>The chief steward, though much
disgusted with the old man's avarice
and extortion, handed over the pieces
of gold which he named as his price
for the maiden and returned to the
palace bringing Leah with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Claudia appointed Leah her own
hand-maiden and soon became very
much attached to her; Leah, in return,
devotedly loved her beautiful
kind mistress.</p>

<p>One day, after she had been some
months in the household of Naaman,
Leah, who had been watching wistfully
her mistress' beautiful, sad face,
said:</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear mistress, how pale
and sorrowful thou looketh. My heart
acheth for thee; would that I could
help thee."</p>

<p>Claudia smiled with infinite sadness
and laid her hand affectionately upon
the dark, curly head of her hand-maiden.</p>

<p>"Thou hast a tender heart, little
one," she said. "I am sure thou
wouldst help me if thou couldst. But
no one can do that, not even the
wisest and greatest in all Syria."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"But there be one in Israel who
can help thee," said the little maid.</p>

<p>"What meaneth thou, child?"
asked Claudia. "Dost thou know
what doth render me so sorrowful?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear mistress," replied the
little maid, "'tis because Naaman,
thy husband, whom thou dost dearly
love, art a leper."</p>

<p>"Ay, most true," murmured Claudia,
with a deep sigh. "Therefore,
maiden, why sayeth thou that there
be one in the land of Israel who can
help me? Surely thou dost know that
no one can heal the leper."</p>

<p>"Listen, dear mistress," said Leah.
"The prophet, Elisha, who is in Samaria,
can heal my lord, thy husband,
for he hath done most wonderful things
even to the raising of the dead to life."</p>

<p>Claudia listened with breathless
eagerness and attention.</p>

<p>"Thou art but a maiden and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
slave," she said, "but I shall give
heed to thy words and repeat them
to Naaman, my husband. Go tell
thy master that I would speak with
him."</p>

<p>When Naaman entered his wife's
presence she turned to meet him with
a look in her beautiful eyes that he
had not seen there in many months.</p>

<p>"Thy little hand-maiden didst tell
me that thou desireth my presence,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Claudia. "Oh,
Naaman, my husband! this little
maid of Israel hath told me most
wonderful things. She claimeth that
in Samaria there is a prophet called
Elisha who hath power to heal thee
of thy leprosy. Oh, my husband,
thou must at once seek this man."</p>

<p>"I must first seek counsel of the
king," said Naaman.</p>

<p>"Then go at once and tell to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
king what the maiden sayeth," cried
Claudia, and Naaman went from her
presence to seek that of Benhadad,
king of Syria.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span></h2>


<p>"What is thy will with me, good
Naaman?" asked Benhadad, king of
Syria, with whom the Syrian general
stood high in favor.</p>

<p>"I am come to seek counsel of
thee, my lord," replied Naaman.
"My wife hath a maid-servant who
cometh from the land of Israel, and
this maiden sayeth that in Samaria
there is a prophet called Elisha, who
hath done most marvelous things even
to the raising of the dead to life. The
maiden claimeth that if I seek the
prophet, Elisha, he will heal me of
my leprosy. What thinketh thou, my
lord? dost thou believe that which
the maiden sayeth be true?"</p>

<p>"I have never heard of this Elisha,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
replied Benhadad. "He is no doubt a
magician, and, if what the maiden
sayeth be true, his power far exceedeth
that of any magician at my court.
Thou shalt journey to Samaria, my
Naaman, bearing a letter from me
to Jehoram, king of Israel. This
Elisha is perhaps attached to the
court of Jehoram, but, if not, the
king hath power to make his subjects
do his bidding. Take with thee gold
in plenty to reward this Elisha."</p>

<p>Naaman kissed the hand of the
king and went forth from his presence.
Upon the day following his
interview with Benhadad, Naaman,
in great pomp and splendor, set forth
upon his journey to Samaria. He
carried with him ten talents of silver,
six thousand pieces of gold (about
sixty thousand dollars) and ten
changes of costly raiment with which
to reward Elisha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The first blush of the rising sun lay
upon the city of Damascus as the
magnificent caravan of Naaman passed
through its gates. Naaman and his
retinue journeyed over the uplands of
Bashan, through the valley of Jordan,
and upon the fifth day stood before
the gates of Samaria.</p>

<p>Then Naaman, ordering the caravan
to halt, called one of his servants
to him and said:</p>

<p>"Send ahead a messenger to Jehoram,
king of Israel, announcing
that Naaman, the great Syrian general,
art approaching with his retinue
and desireth audience with him."</p>

<p>A fair-haired lad, robed in scarlet
and mounted upon a jet-black horse of
wonderful swiftness, bore Naaman's
message to the king. So when the
caravan reached the palace, Jehoram
was waiting to receive Naaman.</p>

<p>Tall and lithe of form, straight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
feature was the Israelite king. The
long hair, bound by the jeweled crown,
was black as the raven's wing. There
was a flush upon his dark brow and
a troubled look in his eyes as Naaman
entered his presence.</p>

<p>"Thou art Naaman, general in the
Syrian Army," he said, "and thou
seeketh speech with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Naaman," replied the
Syrian, as he bent his proud head
before Israel's dark king. "I have
journeyed from Damascus, bearing
this letter from Benhadad, king of all
Syria to Jehoram, king of Israel,"
and taking the parchment from his
breast, he presented it to Jehoram.</p>

<p>The latter read the letter and his
face turned white. Lifting his eyes,
angry and disturbed, he fixed them
upon Naaman.</p>

<p>"Thou art a leper?" he said, while
a look of loathing passed over his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>A dark red flush of shame and humiliation
rose to Naaman's proud brow.
"Yes, my lord, I am a leper," he
replied.</p>

<p>The king fell into deep thought,
his brows drawn together in a frown.</p>

<p>Naaman, standing at the foot of the
throne in torturing suspense, noted
that the king was greatly disturbed.
His thin lips were unsteady, the long,
slim fingers, which held the golden
sceptre, trembled.</p>

<p>At length, the king roused himself,
and, turning his eyes again upon Naaman,
he asked:</p>

<p>"Knoweth thou the contents of this
letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," replied Naaman.</p>

<p>"I must have time to consider this
request of Benhadad," continued the
king. Naaman's face paled. He had
not anticipated any hesitation on the
part of Jehoram to grant the wish of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Benhadad, knowing how unwise it
would be for political reasons for Jehoram
thus to act. If the king of
Israel noted Naaman's disturbance he
gave no sign of it.</p>

<p>"Seek me to-morrow at this time,"
he said, "and thou shalt have my
answer to the letter of thy king."</p>

<p>As soon as Naaman had departed
Jehoram summoned the counselors
and wise men of his kingdom and
thus addressed them:</p>

<p>"Benhadad, king of Syria, seeketh
a quarrel with me. He maketh a request
which he knoweth it be impossible
for me to grant. I fear that he
doth this for the purpose of provoking
war as his father, Benhadad I, before
him, did with my father, Ahab."</p>

<p>"My lord, what meaneth thou?"
anxiously inquired one of the wise
men of the kingdom.</p>

<p>"The king hath sent to me Naaman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the great Syrian general, with a
letter which I will read to thee," replied
the king. "'Now when this letter
is come unto thee, behold I send
herewith Naaman, my servant, that
thou mayest cure him of his leprosy.'
Seeth thou how he seeketh a quarrel
with me?" cried the king, as he
rent his garments. "Am I God
to kill and give life that Benhadad
sendeth to me a man to be cured of
his leprosy?"</p>

<p>The wise men and the counselors
of the kingdom looked silently and
apprehensively into one another's faces,
for they knew not what to say to the
king.</p>

<p>"It doth appear that Benhadad
mocks me," said the king, "for well
he knoweth that no man hath the
power to heal the leper."</p>

<p>"My lord, what answer hast thou
given to Naaman who brought to thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the king's letter?" asked one of the
wise men.</p>

<p>"I have given him as yet no answer,"
replied Jehoram. "I did
send him away, bidding him return
to-morrow. In the meanwhile, I have
summoned thee, my counselors and
wise men, that we may confer together."</p>

<p>"Thinketh thou, my lord, that this
Naaman, who cometh in such pomp
and splendor to Samaria, be in truth
a leper?" asked one of the counselors.</p>

<p>"Truly I know not," answered the
king. "But when I didst ask him if
he were a leper, his face flushed with
shame and he replied, 'Yes, I am a
leper.' He is a man of magnificent
form and stately bearing, he is evidently
of great wealth and high in
favor with Benhadad, Syria's king.
He is also a soldier and a man of
valor. But why waste we time in
discussing this Syrian. Let us rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
take counsel as to what answer we
shall send to his king."</p>

<p>"My lord, what answer canst thou
send to Benhadad, king of Syria, save
that thou art not God and, therefore,
hath not the power to heal the leper?"
asked one of the wise men.</p>

<p>The king frowned.</p>

<p>"Thus would I do as Benhadad
wisheth&mdash;give him pretext to make
war upon me," he cried, impatiently.
"Thou speaketh with scant wisdom,
Mahab. Benhadad knoweth well that
it be not in the power of man to heal
the leper. But I would temporize with
him, not thus openly give him pretext
to make war upon Israel."</p>

<p>At that moment one of the king's
servants entered and said:</p>

<p>"My lord, a servant of the prophet,
Elisha, is without and desireth speech
with thee."</p>

<p>"He must seek me later," cried the
king, impatiently. "I am engaged at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
present with the counselors and wise
men of my kingdom upon a matter of
grave import."</p>

<p>"Pardon thy servant, my lord,"
persisted the servant, "but this man bid
me say that his master hath sent him
to speak words of counsel that neither
the wise men nor the counselors of
thy kingdom could give unto thee."</p>

<p>The king started.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "now I do
remember that this Elisha be a great
prophet and a holy man of God. Go,
bring hither his servant."</p>

<p>The servant withdrew, returning in
few moments with a man simply clad
and grave of mien.</p>

<p>"My lord," he said to Jehoram,
"my master, Elisha, the prophet,
bade me seek thee and say, 'Why hast
thou rent thy garments? Sendeth to
me this Naaman of Syria that he may
know there is a prophet in Israel.'"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>




<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter V.</span></h2>


<p>At the appointed time, upon the
day following, Naaman again presented
himself before Jehoram, king of Israel.</p>

<p>The latter had assembled about him
his courtiers, counselors and wise men.
He appeared no longer troubled nor
disturbed. He looked with serene
eyes upon Naaman, into which, however,
there flashed a look of loathing
as he remembered that the man before
him was a leper.</p>

<p>The courtiers, counselors and wise
men of the Kingdom also looked with
aversion upon Naaman, notwithstanding
the nobility of his form, his handsome,
proud face and the magnificence
of his raiment, for in Israel the leper is
an object of intense aversion, and, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Naaman been an Israelite, he would
have been banished in spite of his
rank, wealth and the services he had
rendered to his country.</p>

<p>The king of Israel and those of his
court were deeply incensed that Benhadad,
king of Syria, had sent into
their midst, to the person of the king
himself, a man afflicted with leprosy.</p>

<p>Naaman stood, with folded arms
and grave face, waiting for the king
to speak.</p>

<p>For some moments Jehoram was
silent, pondering the wisest and most
judicious manner of making known to
Naaman his wish regarding him. The
king was perfectly sure that Elisha
would extricate him from his difficulty,
for had not the prophet bade his servant
say, 'Why hast thou rent thy garments?'
which meant literally, 'Why
art thou troubled and of so little
faith?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>But the king, laboring under an erroneous
idea as to Benhadad's motive
in sending Naaman to him, wished so
to act as to leave Benhadad no pretext
for making war upon him. Benhadad
had in reality desired to be complimentary
in the wording of his letter in
order to propitiate Jehoram, so that the
latter would command Elisha to heal
Naaman.</p>

<p>"Naaman of Syria," said Jehoram,
"I did promise thee an answer to
the letter of thy king. Go thou to the
house in Samaria of the prophet, Elisha,
and say unto him, 'I am Naaman
of Syria, a leper, who hast come to thee
to be made whole.' Then will Elisha
heal thee of thy leprosy."</p>

<p>"My lord, I know not where dwelleth
this Elisha," said Naaman.</p>

<p>"I will send a servant to guide
thee," said the king.</p>

<p>So Naaman entered his chariot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
with all his retinue, started for the
home of the prophet. The king's
servant led the way on foot. The
magnificent caravan passed through
the streets of Samaria, wound among
the hills and stopped before a small
and lowly dwelling.</p>

<p>Lifting himself from among his
silken cushions, Naaman called impatiently
to one of his servants,</p>

<p>"Why hast the caravan come thus
to a halt?"</p>

<p>"At the command of the king's
servant, my lord," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Send to me the king's servant,"
cried Naaman, angrily.</p>

<p>In a few moments the servant of the
king stood beside the chariot.</p>

<p>"Why hast thou thus stopped the
caravan of Naaman?" asked the Syrian
nobleman, angrily.</p>

<p>"My lord, I am but fulfilling the
orders of the king, my master," was
the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou speaketh falsely," cried
Naaman, with increasing anger. "Thy
master didst command thee to conduct
me to the house of Elisha, the
prophet."</p>

<p>"My lord, I have obeyed the order of
my master," said the servant. "This
is the house of Elisha, the prophet."</p>

<p>"'Tis impossible!" cried Naaman,
incredulously. "A great man like
Elisha must surely dwell in a palace.
This is the abode of a man, humble,
obscure; Elisha is rich and famous."</p>

<p>The king's servant regarded Naaman
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, my lord, but thou
dost know little regarding the prophet
Elisha," he said. "'Tis true that his
fame hath gone forth over the land,
but Elisha hath not riches; he is a
man, poor and humble; he dwelleth
not in a palace, this is his home."</p>

<p>Naaman, perplexed and wondering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
waved the servant of the king impatiently
aside and summoning one of
his own servants, said to him:</p>

<p>"Go thou into the house of Elisha
and say to him that Naaman, general
in the Syrian Army, high in favor
with Benhadad, king of Syria, doth
desire speech with him."</p>

<p>The servant passed into the house
of Elisha. In a short while he came
forth alone.</p>

<p>"Is not the prophet, Elisha, within?"
asked Naaman, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," was the answer, "but
I saw him not. The servant of Elisha
did carry the message to his master."</p>

<p>"And what answer sendeth Elisha?"
asked Naaman, with eagerness.</p>

<p>"Elisha desireth to know, my lord,
what is thy will with him," replied
the servant.</p>

<p>Naaman's brow darkened with displeasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it thus that the great and rich
Naaman of Syria is received by the
poor and humble Elisha?" he cried.
Then, remembering the errand upon
which he had come, he controlled his
indignation, thinking, "I must humor
this man if I would have my will of
him: Go thou again into the house of
Elisha," he said, "and bid the servant
say to his master, that Naaman
of Syria hath journeyed from Damascus
that Elisha may heal him of his
leprosy."</p>

<p>The servant turned away and passed
into the house. In a few minutes he
returned with the servant of Elisha
who, approaching Naaman, said:</p>

<p>"My master, Elisha sayeth unto
Naaman of Syria, 'Go thou and bathe
seven times in the Jordan and thy
flesh shalt recover health and thou
shalt be clean.'"</p>

<p>"Dost thy master mean to mock me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that he treateth me as though I were
but a common outcast leper?" cried
Naaman. "I did think that he
would have come out to see me, and,
touching with his hand the place of
the leprosy, would have invoked the
name of Jehovah, his God, and healed
me. Go wash seven times in the
Jordan? What marvelous power doth
the Jordan possess? But enough of this
folly. Thy master doth but speak in
jest. Go say to him that Naaman of
Syria came not to be mocked, but to
be cured of his leprosy, and that he
bringeth with him a great treasure
with which to reward Elisha."</p>

<p>"My lord, it would avail naught
for me to carry thy message to my
master," said the servant. "Elisha
hath spoken," and, turning, he passed
quietly among the servants of Naaman
and entered the lowly dwelling of his
master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Naaman sat for some moments in
silence. The servant of the king
looked up at him eagerly and seemed
about to speak, but awed, perhaps, by
the Syrian's white face and sombre
eyes, remained silent.</p>

<p>At length, Naaman roused himself,
sprang to his feet, and drawing his
splendid form to its full height, cried
in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Back to Damascus! Naaman hath
but come upon a fool's errand." Then
turning upon the servant of the king,
he cried, in tones of great anger, "Go
to thy master, Jehoram, king of Israel,
and say to him that Benhadad, king
of all Syria, will know how to avenge
the insult that hath been offered to
Naaman."</p>

<p>"But, my lord, the king, my master,
didst intend thee no insult," protested
the servant. "The ways of Elisha are
not like unto the ways of other men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop not to parley with me!" cried
Naaman, furiously. "Be gone ere I
bid my servants drive thee hence."</p>

<p>The servant of the king bowed his
head and passed swiftly away.</p>

<p>"Now, onward to Damascus," said
Naaman, throwing himself wearily
back upon the cushions.</p>

<p>At that moment, however, one of
Naaman's servants, a white-haired old
man, approached the chariot and said:</p>

<p>"Wilt my lord hear patiently old
Masrekah whose hair has grown gray
in his service and who didst serve his
father before him?"</p>

<p>"Speak, my good Masrekah," answered
Naaman.</p>

<p>"My lord, thou art a mighty man
of valor and know not the meaning of
fear," continued Masrekah. "If the
prophet, Elisha, bade thee do some act
difficult of achievement, thou wouldst
have listened and obeyed?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, most willingly," replied Naaman.</p>

<p>"Then, my master, do not despise
this thing that Elisha bid thee do
because it is a simple thing," said
Masrekah. "My lord, I do not believe
that Elisha doth intend thee mockery
and insult. Didst thou not take heed of
the words of the king's servant, 'The
ways of Elisha are not like unto the
ways of other men?' Thou, my lord,
didst expect to find him in a palace, but
instead he dwelleth as do the poor and
lowly. Thou didst think that he would
heal thee with ostentatious and impressive
ceremonial, but he sendeth thee
word to go to bathe seven times in the
Jordan and thou shalt be clean. My
Lord, despise not the bidding of Elisha."</p>

<p>"Thou speaketh with the wisdom of
years, my good Masrekah," answered
Naaman. "Naaman will give heed
to thy words. I go to bathe seven
times in the Jordan."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>




<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter VI.</span></h2>


<p>Upon leaving the caravan of Naaman,
the servant of the king returned
to the palace and sought his master.</p>

<p>"What tidings dost thou bring?"
asked Jehoram. "Hath Elisha healed
Naaman of his leprosy?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord," replied the servant,
"and I bring to thee a message from
Naaman who is greatly incensed,"
and he repeated to the king Naaman's
message.</p>

<p>Jehoram's face grew pale.</p>

<p>The servant then proceeded to relate
how Elisha had received Naaman and
what he had bid him do.</p>

<p>"What meaneth Elisha?" cried Jehoram,
in fear and anger. "Does he
not know that he will bring destruction
upon Israel?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did say unto Naaman of Syria
that the ways of Elisha, the prophet,
were not like unto the ways of other
men," said the servant. "But Naaman
would not give heed to my words,
he angrily bade me be gone."</p>

<p>"Go, mount the fleetest horse in my
possession and make haste to the house
of Elisha," commanded the king.
"Say to him that if Naaman of Syria
returneth in anger to Damascus, Benhadad,
king of all Syria, will at once
declare war upon Israel. Say to Elisha
that Jehoram his king, doth command
him to heal Naaman of his leprosy
lest destruction come upon Israel."</p>

<p>"But, my lord, pardon thy servant
for reminding thee that Naaman of
Syria refused to do the bidding of
Elisha," said the servant. "He believeth
that Elisha does but mock him."</p>

<p>"Ah, this worshipper of a false god
understandeth not the ways of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
prophet of the true God of Israel,"
cried the king, scornfully. "But be
that as it may Naaman must not return
unhealed and in anger to Damascus.
So go thou with all speed and deliver
my message to Elisha. The caravan
of Naaman cannot have proceeded far;
thou canst still overtake it after thou
hast seen Elisha. Lose not a moment;
go!"</p>

<p>After the departure of his servant
Jehoram shut himself up alone in his
chamber. He sought not the counsel
of the wise men of his kingdom; he
knew that no one could extricate him
from threatened disaster save Elisha.</p>

<p>Impatiently the king tossed aside
the jeweled crown which rested so
heavily upon his aching brows.</p>

<p>"Ah, can all the glory of a king
compensate for the cares that lie so
heavily upon him? Jehoram, king of
all Israel, often envyeth the humblest
of his subjects."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Time passed and the king, restless
with suspense, consumed with anxiety,
awaited the coming of his servant. At
length, the servant returned.</p>

<p>"Speak; what tidings dost thou
bring?" cried the king.</p>

<p>"My lord," replied the servant, "I
did hasten, as thou commanded, to
the house of Elisha. His servant admitted
me to the presence of the
prophet and I delivered to him thy
message. Elisha heard me in silence,
then he spoke. 'Jehoram, king of
Israel, hath but little faith,' he said.
'Go to thy master and say unto him
that Naaman will return to Damascus
healed of his leprosy.'"</p>

<p>A long sigh of relief broke from the
lips of the king.</p>

<p>"Elisha be a prophet and a holy
man of God," he said, "therefore, will
I believe his words and have faith in
him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter VII.</span></h2>


<p>An hour before sunset, upon the day
following his departure from Damascus,
the caravan of Naaman reached
the banks of the Jordan. The Jordan
was very different from the beautiful
Syrian rivers, Abaha and Pharpar.
Its waters, muddy and discolored,
flowed sluggishly between unshaded
banks covered with coarse grass and
rank weeds.</p>

<p>Naaman descended from his chariot
and advanced to the banks of the river.
He stood, for some moments, frowningly
regarding the discolored water
as it crept to his feet, then he threw
aside his purple robe, disclosing upon
his broad chest awful, loathsome
sores. He stepped into the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few minutes he stood again
upon the bank. His great muscular
arms were crossed upon his breast, a
gray pallor lay upon his face.</p>

<p>"I have done the bidding of Elisha,"
he cried, "I have bathed seven times
in the Jordan, but my brain doth whirl,
my eyes are dim and blurred. Masrekah,
faithful servant, 'tis for thee to
speak&mdash;am I whole or am I still a
leper?" and he threw his arms wide
apart.</p>

<p>In silent wonder and awe the servants
of Naaman gazed upon their master.
The loathsome, leprous spots had
entirely disappeared, his flesh "was
like unto the flesh of a little child."</p>

<p>But Naaman knew not that he was
healed. His eyes, dim and dazed,
were fixed upon the old servant. One
downward glance would have told him
all, but Naaman, soldier and mighty
man of valor, now knew a coward's fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Masrekah came forward, and falling
at his master's feet, covered his hands
with kisses and tears of joy.</p>

<p>"Master! dearest master!" he cried,
"thou art healed! thou art clean!
thou art no more a leper."</p>

<p>A great tremor shook Naaman's
massive limbs. He grew weak as a
little child, his lips quivered and tears
filled his eyes. His servants broke into
shouts of joy and exultation. They
threw themselves on their knees before
Naaman, kissing his hands and feet.</p>

<p>"Arise, my good and faithful servants,"
said Naaman. "Turn we our
faces again towards Samaria. I go to
seek the prophet, Elisha."</p>

<p>Masrekah laid his hand upon Naaman's
arm.</p>

<p>"My lord," he said, "thou hast forgotten
to render thanks to Rimmon,
god of Syria, for the great good that
hath been done unto thee. Masrekah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
thus presumeth to remind his lord lest
the god, being angered, should send
some calamity upon Naaman."</p>

<p>Naaman smiled.</p>

<p>"Naaman shall not render thanks
to Rimmon, god of Syria," he said.
"Nor doth Naaman fear the anger of
Syria's god. Nay, be not troubled,
my good Masrekah, all will be well
with Naaman."</p>

<p>Naaman then arrayed himself in
his purple robe and passed on to his
chariot. For a moment he stood gazing
upon the waters of the Jordan to
which the crimson glow from the
setting sun lent fleeting beauty. His
eyes were filled with a great joy, an
immeasurable peace. Then he stepped
into his chariot and motioned for the
caravan to proceed.</p>

<p>It was the same hour, upon the
next day, that the caravan of Naaman
again stood before the humble dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of Elisha. Naaman, calling one
of his servants to him, said:</p>

<p>"Go thou into the house of Elisha
and say to him, 'Naaman of Syria,
having done thy bidding, bathed seven
times in the Jordan, has come forth
whole. He most earnestly desireth
speech with thee, that he may tell to
thee how his heart has changed, also
give unto thee the ten talents of silver,
six thousand pieces of gold and ten
changes of raiment which he brought
with him from Damascus.'"</p>

<p>The servant passed into the house
of the prophet. In a short time he
returned, saying:</p>

<p>"Elisha will come forth, my lord,
and speak with thee."</p>

<p>Naaman alighted from the chariot
and awaited the coming of the prophet.
After a little while a man stepped
through the low doorway of the humble
dwelling and approached Naaman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Tall and spare in figure, he wore a
dark, coarse, robe, over which flowed
a long, gray beard. His face was pale
and worn, his eyes gentle and calm.</p>

<p>Naaman sank upon his knees at
the feet of the prophet.</p>

<p>"Arise, Naaman of Syria," said
Elisha, in a voice of wonderful sweetness.</p>

<p>Naaman pressed the coarse robe of
the prophet to his lips ere he rose to
his feet. Then, calling to his servants,
he said:</p>

<p>"Bring hither the treasure which
Naaman brought with him from
Damascus to reward Elisha."</p>

<p>"Nay, Naaman of Syria must take
back with him to Damascus the treasure
he did bring," said Elisha.
"Elisha desireth not riches nor the
praise of men. 'Twas not for these
things that he didst heal Naaman of
his leprosy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Naaman, seeing that it would be
quite useless to endeavor to force reward
upon the prophet, signed to his
servants to leave undisturbed the
treasure. Then, again kneeling at
Elisha's feet, he cried, aloud:</p>

<p>"Elisha, through thee it has been
revealed to me that there is no god in
all the earth but only in Israel. Henceforth,
Naaman will offer sacrifice only
to the true God of Israel."</p>

<p>"Peace be with thee, Naaman of
Syria," said the prophet, with his
sweet, gentle smile. "'Tis indeed
well with thee. A greater good has
come to thee than the healing of thy
body from the foulness of leprosy. Go
thou in peace."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII.</span></h2>


<p>The days passed very slowly and
wearily to Claudia, wife of Naaman,
as she awaited in her palace home the
return of her husband. Sometimes
her heart was filled with hope, then,
again, she would be plunged into the
deepest despondency, when it seemed
madness to believe that any man had
power to heal the leper.</p>

<p>Leah, the little maid, watched her
mistress wistfully, tenderly. One
morning, as she sat at Claudia's feet,
she looked up into her pale, beautiful
face and said:</p>

<p>"Why art thou so sad, my dear
mistress?"</p>

<p>"Ah, maiden," replied Claudia,
"thou canst not understand the tortures
of suspense which consume me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suspense!" repeated the little
maid. "Then thou dost doubt the
power of Elisha to heal my lord of
his leprosy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Claudia. "For how
can man be possessed of such power?"</p>

<p>A smile of rare sweetness lighted up
the face of the little maid.</p>

<p>"My own dear mistress, put aside
all thy doubts, all thy trouble, for my
lord will return healed of his leprosy,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Child, great indeed is thy faith in
this man, Elisha," said Claudia.
"Hast thou ever seen him, spoken
with him?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the little maid. "I
was on my way to seek him when I
was captured by the Syrians."</p>

<p>"What was thy purpose in seeking
Elisha, maiden?" asked Claudia.</p>

<p>Leah's lips quivered, her soft eyes
filled with tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the land of Israel I have a
brother who has been a cripple from
birth," she murmured. "I was on
my way to Samaria to seek Elisha and
beg of him that he heal my brother."</p>

<p>"But, child, thou art poor, how
didst thou propose to reward Elisha for
healing thy brother?" asked Claudia.</p>

<p>The little maid looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"What meaneth thou, dear mistress?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Surely thou knoweth, maiden,
that the magicians of the court of
Benhadad, king of Syria, receive rich
salaries," replied Claudia. "But even
they possess not the power of this
Elisha for they cannot heal the leper.
Therefore, Elisha must be even more
richly rewarded than are the magicians
of Benhadad's court."</p>

<p>"Dear mistress, Elisha is no magician,
but a holy man of God," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the little maid. "He dwelleth not at
the court of the king, neither does he
receive aught in recompense for the
good that he doeth."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do not understand," murmured
Claudia, perplexedly. "Why,
Naaman, my husband, did take with
him to Samaria ten talents of silver,
six thousand pieces of gold and ten
changes of raiment with which to
reward Elisha should he be healed of
his leprosy."</p>

<p>Leah smiled.</p>

<p>"My lord will bring back with him
from Damascus the ten talents of
silver, the six thousand pieces of gold
and the ten changes of raiment," she
said, "for Elisha will have none of
them."</p>

<p>Claudia sat for some moments in
thought.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this Elisha is a seeker
after fame, and so to win the praise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
men he uses his power for the poor as
well as the rich," she said, at length.
"But I believe not that he will refuse
the treasure which my husband carried
with him to Samaria."</p>

<p>Leah did not answer. Claudia, after
regarding her attentively for some
moments, said:</p>

<p>"Thou seemeth to give no heed to
my words, maiden. Dost thou in truth
believe that Elisha will refuse to
receive the treasure which Naaman
carryeth with him?"</p>

<p>"I know dear mistress, that Elisha
will refuse to accept the treasure
which my lord carryeth with him to
Samaria," replied the little maid,
firmly. "Elisha careth not for riches
nor the praise of men. He seeketh
only to please and serve the Lord who
hath given to him his great power."</p>

<p>"What manner of man is this Elisha
who can inspire such great and unswerving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
faith?" mused Claudia. "Is
the God of Israel more powerful than
the god of Syria, for Rimmon hath
given to no man in Syria power like
unto that possessed by Elisha?" she
said aloud.</p>

<p>The little maid looked up earnestly
into her mistress' beautiful face.</p>

<p>"There is no God save the God of
Israel," she said.</p>

<p>Claudia smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>"Thou art of the land of Israel, little
one," she said, "and, therefore, thou
dost believe that the God Israel worships
be the only true God. Perhaps,
if thou dwelleth long in Syria, thou
will learn to worship Syria's god."</p>

<p>"No, dear lady, that could never
be," replied Leah, earnestly. "I may
see no more my people and my
country, but I shall ever remain faithful
to my God. He dwelleth not alone
in the land of Israel, but he ruleth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
over all the earth. 'Tis He, Who
through his prophet, will heal thy
husband of his leprosy."</p>

<p>"Thou speaketh idle words child,"
said Claudia, a little impatiently.
"The God of Israel would not bestow
His favors upon a Syrian who does
worship Syria's god. But, there,
enough of this; let us speak of other
things. Tell me of thy people. Hast
thou brothers and sisters in the land
of Israel?"</p>

<p>"I have but one brother, dear mistress,"
replied Leah.</p>

<p>"And this brother has been a
cripple from birth?" gently asked
Claudia.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear mistress."</p>

<p>"And thou dost love him very
dearly?"</p>

<p>"Ah, so dearly," murmured the
little maid, with quivering lips.</p>

<p>"Poor child, thy young life has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
known much sorrow," said Claudia,
pityingly. "And, yet, thou thinketh
more of the sorrows of others than of
thy own."</p>

<p>"My heart is sad at times," said
Leah. "But I must not rebel against
the will of the good God."</p>

<p>"And is this why thou dost bear so
patiently and unmurmuringly the sorrows
which have darkened thy young
life?" asked Claudia, wonderingly.
"But the gods are wont to send afflictions
upon those who offend them,
thou canst not have offended thy God."</p>

<p>"God, in His wisdom, doth often
afflict those whom He loveth," said
Leah.</p>

<p>Claudia smiled.</p>

<p>"This God of thine is a strange
God," she said.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter IX.</span></h2>


<p>When fourteen days had passed since
his departure for Samaria, the caravan
of Naaman again entered the gates of
Damascus.</p>

<p>The little maid, learning of this,
made haste to seek her mistress.</p>

<p>"Dear mistress," she said, "the
caravan of my lord has entered the
city and proceedeth to the palace of
Benhadad, the king."</p>

<p>Claudia turned very white.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and what other tidings dost
thou bring?" she faltered. "Speak,
child; keep me not in suspense."</p>

<p>"I bring no further tidings, my
mistress," answered the little maid.</p>

<p>Claudia sank upon a couch, trembling
and faint. Leah knelt beside
her and kissed her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why dost thou tremble and grow
pale, dear mistress," she asked. "I
did come to thee at once with the
tidings of my lord's return, thinking
that thou wouldst rejoice and be
happy."</p>

<p>"If I knew that he were healed then
indeed would I rejoice," said Claudia.
"But if he be not healed my heart
will be filled with sadness and sad
indeed our meeting."</p>

<p>"Be at peace, my lady," said the
little maid, earnestly. "My lord has
returned healed of his leprosy."</p>

<p>"Thou hast indeed great faith,
child," said Claudia, with a faint
smile. "But only when I hear from
the lips of my husband that he is
healed will I believe. But, come and
array me, for whether Naaman
return in sorrow or gladness I will do
him honor."</p>

<p>The little maid hastened to put a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
rich silken robe upon her mistress,
binding back her golden hair with a
circlet of glittering gems.</p>

<p>"Come," then said Claudia, "thou
shalt await with me the coming of
Naaman."</p>

<p>Upon entering Damascus, Naaman
had at once sought the palace of the
king.</p>

<p>The latter received him most graciously,
saying:</p>

<p>"What fortune did attend thy
journey into the land of Israel, my
good Naaman?"</p>

<p>"My lord, I return healed of my leprosy,"
replied Naaman.</p>

<p>"Thou cometh indeed with wonderful
tidings," exclaimed the king.
"Marvelous is the power of this magician
of the court of Jehoram. What
sayeth thy wife, the beautiful Claudia?
great rejoicing must indeed be hers."</p>

<p>"She as yet knows not that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
returned from Samaria," answered
Naaman. "I did first seek the presence
of my king to make known to
him the wonders that have been done
unto me."</p>

<p>"Ah," murmured Benhadad, "thou
art ever faithful to thy country and
thy king."</p>

<p>The proud eyes of the Syrian wavered
and fell under the king's kind
gaze.</p>

<p>"Ah," he was thinking, "the king
knows not that I have forsaken the
god of my country for Jehovah Who
ruleth over all the earth."</p>

<p>"I will detain thee no longer at present,"
said Benhadad. "Make haste
to the presence of thy wife with thy
tidings of joy. Meanwhile the news
shall go abroad over all the land that
Naaman has returned from Samaria
healed of his leprosy that all Syria
may rejoice and offer sacrifice to Rimmon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Say to thy wife that Benhadad
rejoices with her that Naaman has
returned healed."</p>

<p>Naaman bent his head to kiss the
hand of the king and then left the
palace. As the chariot passed through
the streets of Damascus shouts of rejoicing
were heard upon every side;
Benhadad had already sent forth the
tidings of the healing of Naaman.</p>

<p>Claudia, awaiting the coming of her
husband, heard the shouts and cries
and turned very pale.</p>

<p>"What means those cries?" she
asked of the little maid.</p>

<p>"My lord passes through the streets
of Damascus and the people rejoices
that he is healed," answered Leah.</p>

<p>"Only when I hear from the lips of
my husband that he be healed will I
believe," again said Claudia.</p>

<p>The servants of the palace then took
up the joyous cries; Naaman had
passed through the gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>A few moments more and the embroidered
draperies were put aside and
Naaman stood upon the threshold of
the great chamber. And as she looked
into his face Claudia knew how it was
with him. She moved forward and
was folded to his breast. And the
little maid, with tears in her eyes,
passed out of the chamber, leaving
them alone.</p>

<p>After a little while, however, she
was summoned to the presence of Naaman.
Claudia, her beautiful face all
aglow with happiness, stood by her
husband's side.</p>

<p>"Maiden," said Naaman, "Elisha,
whose great powers thou didst make
known to me, has healed me of my
leprosy."</p>

<p>"My lord, my heart is indeed glad
that thou hast returned healed of thy
leprosy," said the little maid.</p>

<p>"And thou, maiden, shall be rewarded,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
continued Naaman. "Ask
of me what thou wilt and it shall be
granted unto thee."</p>

<p>The little maid fell upon her knees
at his feet.</p>

<p>"O, my lord," she cried, "I would
return to those who love me and sorrow
for me in the dear land of Israel.
I crave of thee but one thing, my lord&mdash;freedom."</p>

<p>"It is granted thee," said Naaman.
"Thou art no more a slave."</p>

<p>The little maid caught his hand and
covered it with kisses. Claudia stooped
and lifted her to her feet.</p>

<p>"It grieves me to part with thee,
little one," she said. "But I shall be
glad that thou art happy with those
whom thou dost love."</p>

<p>"I shall never forget thee nor cease
to love thee," murmured Leah.</p>

<p>"Maiden, hast thou no further desire?"
asked Naaman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"What more could I desire, my
lord, since thou hast given me my
freedom?" replied the little maid.</p>

<p>"Thou art poor," said Naaman.
"Hast thou never craved riches?"</p>

<p>"Not for myself, my lord," answered
Leah. "But I have often
wished that my parents were not
forced to labor so hard."</p>

<p>"Thy parents shall labor no more,"
said Naaman, quietly.</p>

<p>"What meaneth thou, my lord?"
murmured the little maid, bewilderedly.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, maiden," continued
Naaman. "I did carry with me to
Samaria ten talents of silver, six thousand
pieces of gold and ten changes
of raiment with which to reward
Elisha should he heal me of my
leprosy."</p>

<p>Leah smiled.</p>

<p>"And Elisha did refuse to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the treasure which thou didst carry
with thee to Samaria," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Naaman, "but the
treasure which Elisha did refuse
shall be thine."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Chapter X.</span></h2>


<p>Early upon the morning following
a servant came to Leah and said:</p>

<p>"There be a lad outside the gates of
the palace who desires speech with
thee."</p>

<p>"A lad desires speech with me,"
said the little maid, wonderingly.
"But I know no lad in Damascus."</p>

<p>"He inquired for the Israelite maiden
who is a slave in the house of Naaman,"
replied the servant. "'Tis
only a ragged beggar lad," and the
servant turned scornfully away.</p>

<p>Leah passed out of the palace and
ran down to the great gates.</p>

<p>Beyond the gates, for the servant
had not permitted him to enter, stood
a lad. His coarse garments were
soiled and torn, his bare feet were cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and bleeding. The golden light from
the rising sun fell upon his dark curly
head.</p>

<p>Uttering a cry of joy, he ran, with
outstretched hands, towards the little
maid.</p>

<p>"Leah! sister! I have found thee at
last!" he cried.</p>

<p>She stood motionless, gazing at him
with wide, bewildered eyes.</p>

<p>"Isaac! my brother! is it indeed
thou?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'tis indeed thy Isaac!" he
answered. "But, as thou dost see, no
longer a cripple for Elisha has made
me whole."</p>

<p>"Elisha has made thee whole,"
she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes; listen, and I will tell thee all,"
said Isaac. "I will speak but briefly
of the sorrow which did fill our hearts
when thou wert captured by the Syrians.
Had I not been a helpless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
cripple I would have gone forth to seek
thee. Then one day our mother called
our father to her and said, 'Unless
thou seeketh help we shall soon have
no child, for Isaac will die of his grief
for his sister.' 'Where and of whom
shall I seek help?' asked our father.
'Journey to Samaria and seek the prophet,
Elisha,' answered our mother.
'Tell to him how heavily the hand of
misfortune has fallen upon our home.
Beg of him to return with thee and
heal our son.'</p>

<p>"So upon the morrow our father
did borrow the ass of our neighbor
and set forth upon his journey to Samaria.
In the evening he returned,
bringing Elisha with him. That
night, sister, while our parents slept,
Elisha came and stood beside my
couch. I felt the touch of his hand
upon my limbs and I heard his voice
saying, 'With the sun thou shalt rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
from thy couch and walk.' Then he
was gone and it seemed to me I had
but dreamed. When the morning had
come and the sun had risen, Elisha was
gone, but I did arise from my couch
and walk, for I was strong and made
whole.</p>

<p>"Then did I set forth to seek thee.
I was many days in reaching Damascus.
I was often hungry and footsore,
but I was happy for I was no longer
a cripple. But yesterday I did pass
through the gates of Damascus. There
was great excitement upon the streets.
The people were shouting and uttering
cries of joy. I learned that they were
rejoicing because Naaman, a great Syrian
general and favorite of the king,
Benhadad, had returned from Samaria
healed of his leprosy.</p>

<p>"I asked a woman in the crowd
who had healed Naaman. 'A great
man called Elisha,' she replied. 'Tis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
said that Naaman did hear of this
Elisha through a little Israelite maid
who is a slave in Naaman's household.'
Oh, dear sister, how I did
rejoice at her words for I knew then
that I had found thee. I am come to
offer myself as Naaman's slave that I
may ransom thee."</p>

<p>Leah put her arms tenderly about
his neck.</p>

<p>"Brother," she said, "I am no more
a slave; neither shalt thou nor our
parents labor, for Naaman has made
me rich. Oh! dear brother! our hearts
should indeed be filled with gratitude
to Jehovah, Israel's God."</p>
